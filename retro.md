Slideshow Retrospective
=======================

## What went well

* Able to apply a design pattern almost subconsciously
* For the most part, adheres to SOLID principles and has a layered architecture
* Fast feedback through exploratory 'learning' tests.
* Understood the quirks of `curses` with minimal frustration
* The daunting task of splitting sentences on spaces across lines became a lot easier once talking about the approach

## To improve

* It's not very well tested, possibly due to how `curses` just doesn't work in PyCharm
* Decoupling from `curses` or other framework used for any other framework requires extra forethought and effort
* When in doubt, start with a simple object rather than a class-based thingamajig
* Decomposing complex algorithms into functions or classes sooner rather than later (extract method)

## Actions

* For next project, think about how the structure of the code uses the framework and how that can be turned on its head to test the behaviour
* Focus on making everything smaller and simpler
